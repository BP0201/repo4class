// a query string is the last part of the URL, where you see different values that have been submitted, some automatically. This looks like ?x=1&y=2
// GET and POST. They are used to request/send data, GET does not change any data on the server, however POST will. 
// an HTTP request is the request you would make with these verbs. they are used to request/send data.
