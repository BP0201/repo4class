# Getflix
For my Capstone Project I have created a web-app called Getflix using the Movie Database API: https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction

Users must create an account before accessing any data, and will then have access to the hottest movies/shows every week, as well as search for any film or series listed in the API via title or actor.

If they like one of the results, they can then add it to their favorites which can be viewed at anytime.
